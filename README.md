# Apollo-Zoho Enricher

A **real-time enrichment microservice** that connects Zoho CRM to Apollo.io.  
When you click a custom button in Zoho, it sends your company name (and optionally its domain) to this service. Behind the scenes:

1. **FastAPI** accepts the request and immediately returns a `202 Accepted` with a `task_id`.
2. **Celery** (backed by Redis) picks up the enrichment job.
3. **Apollo.io API** calls resolve the domain, fetch full organization data, then search & enrich key people.
4. **MySQL** stores core records in `companies` & `people` tables and full JSON blobs in `organization_details` & `person_details`.
5. _(Future)_: A periodic Celery task will push the enriched data back up to Zoho via the Zoho v2 REST API.
